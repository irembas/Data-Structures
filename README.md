# Data Structures Project Repository
This repository contains various programming projects, each implementing different data structures in the C programming language. Each project is intended to provide a deeper understanding of how various data structures operate, and how they can be used to solve a wide array of problems.

# Featured Data Structures:
Linked List: A linear collection of data elements, each pointing to the next, enabling efficient insertion and deletion.

Graphs: A non-linear data structure comprised of nodes and edges. The projects involve adjacency list and matrix representations, with algorithms for traversing, searching, and finding the shortest paths in graphs.

Queues: A linear data structure that operates based on the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. The primary operations include enqueue (insertion) and dequeue (removal).

Neighbourhood Lists: This is a specific representation of graphs where each node maintains a list of all nodes that it is directly connected to.

String Operations: These projects involve manipulation of strings and patterns, using various algorithms for searching, sorting, matching, and more.

Trees: A non-linear data structure characterized by a hierarchical relationship amongst its elements. Projects cover binary trees, tree traversal, search algorithms, insertion, and deletion operations.

Tries: An efficient information retrieval data structure, typically used for searching words in dictionaries, providing auto suggestions during word entry, and more.

# Setup and Execution:
Each project is stored in a dedicated folder within this repository. Navigate to the desired project folder.

Along with the .c source code files, each project folder contains a README file and a .pdf file. The README file provides an overview of the project, the problem it aims to solve, and instructions on how to execute the code. The .pdf file contains the output results of the code.

The code is compatible with any C compiler. If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can simply open the .c file and press F5 to run it.

# Contribution:
Contributions to this repository are welcomed. If you have an interesting problem that can be solved using data structures or if you've implemented a unique solution using data structures, feel free to submit a pull request.

# Note:
This repository is primarily a learning resource for those looking to delve into the world of data structures. A sound understanding of data structures and their applications is fundamental to Computer Science and Software Engineering. These projects can be used as a reference for academic study, self-learning, or in preparation for technical interviews. Happy coding!
